My goal for this project is to create a chess clock using an Arduino microcontroller that can announce a winner and activate a buzzer when a timer reaches zero. I went through a few different designs but settled on a simple square look with two buttons on top and an LCD screen for the timers. A 30-minute timer is used for both players with the other players timer being activated when the opposing player presses their button to end their turn. Once a timer reaches zero a buzzer goes off and a message displays on the LCD screen saying who won.",

It carries the ability to be plugged into a TV or monitor and can be controlled by a standard keyboard and mouse. I installed an OS called RetroPie that allows you to play games from various consoles. The key functionality of the project is to: run your favorite games, like the classic Mario and Donkey Kong, and its compact size can allow it to fit in your pocket and be used almost anywhere.",

This included a PoE switch, four cameras, cat 6 cable, cable crimpers and jacks for the cables. I installed these around my home, through the PoE switch. Using a computer that is networked to the switch, I installed a program called Blue Iris. \nThis program allows me to set up and control each camera individually, and it allows me to controlmany features, such as triggers, PTZ (pan, tilt, zoom – if supported by the cameras), notifications, etc. The design of the network and hardware will allow me to expand the camera system in the future.
